//! Verifying a chain of Verifiable Delegation Credentials.
//!
//! # What a VDC chain establishes, and what it does not
//!
//! A delegation chain answers exactly one question: *may this party act in the
//! principal's name, for this act?* It does **not** answer whether the act is permitted.
//! A VDC neither carries authority nor confers it — a verifier substitutes the principal
//! for the delegate and then asks the permission question it would have asked of the
//! principal directly, live, at the time of the act.
//!
//! [`verify_chain`] therefore returns a [`VerifiedDelegation`] naming the principal and
//! the acts the chain appoints for. That is one of two checks. The other — may the
//! *principal* do this? — is the caller's, and a governing party may add a third: whether
//! the delegate must independently qualify. The reach of a delegated act is the
//! **intersection** of what the principal may do and what the chain appoints for; never
//! the union, and never more than either.
//!
//! # Re-delegation is opt-in, unlike attenuation
//!
//! A VAC may be attenuated by default; a VDC may be re-delegated only where its `maxDepth`
//! says so, and absence prohibits it. The asymmetry is deliberate. A delegate speaks in
//! the principal's name, so the principal keeps the register of who may do that and can
//! withdraw any of them; a delegate that needs a further delegate ordinarily asks for a
//! fresh root delegation rather than minting one. Re-delegation exists for when that round
//! trip is unavailable.
//!
//! # Bearer-side resolution
//!
//! As in [`crate::authority`], the holder presents every link and this module never
//! dereferences a `parent` to fetch one. Presenting a derived VDC discloses the whole
//! ancestry, including the principal's identity — which is the other reason a single hop
//! is the default.
//!
//! # A VDC is not a bearer credential
//!
//! [`verify_chain`] takes a `presenter` and requires the leaf to appoint it. That is the
//! **Invocation Binding** rule of Working Draft 02, stated normatively: *a verifier MUST
//! NOT accept a party as acting in the delegator's name unless that party demonstrates
//! control of the verification method associated with `credentialSubject.id` at the time
//! of the request. A VDC presented without such a demonstration is evidence that a
//! delegation exists; it is not evidence that the party presenting it is the delegate.*
//!
//! Same rule, and the same reasoning, as [`crate::authority::verify_chain`]. Acting in
//! another's name is if anything the sharper case: a captured VAC replays whatever it
//! confers, while a captured VDC replays *as somebody*, and every act it carries is
//! attributed to the principal.
//!
//! **What `presenter` must be.** The identifier of a party whose key control the caller
//! has already established for *this request* — the DID a transport authenticated, or one
//! a signature over the request proved. Passing an identifier the caller merely read out
//! of the request body reduces this check to a string comparison an attacker chooses both
//! sides of.
//!
//! **Only the leaf's delegate demonstrates anything.** The parties above it in the chain
//! are not present and are asked for nothing. Requiring otherwise would defeat
//! re-delegation, whose whole purpose is that the delegator is not in the loop when its
//! delegate acts.
//!
//! # Not implemented here
//!
//! **The acceptance.** A delegation edge is complete only when the delegate has
//! countersigned, and a verifier MUST obtain and verify that half before accepting any
//! party as acting under the delegation. This module verifies the grant chain;
//! [`crate::DTGCredential::accepts`] checks an acceptance against its grant, and a
//! verifier needs both.
//!
//! **Revocation.** A VDC's `credentialStatus` is a live lookup this crate does not
//! perform. See [`crate::DTGCommon::credential_status`].
//!
//! Nothing else. Invocation binding used to be listed here; see below.
